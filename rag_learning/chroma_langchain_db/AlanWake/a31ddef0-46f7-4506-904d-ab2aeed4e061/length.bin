The plot of AWE confirmed this, tying up some loose ends from the previous Alan Wake entries while also setting up details which would come in a sequel work. In the ending of AWE, an alarm sounds in the Federal Bureau of Control that another AWE appears to be happening again in Bright Falls. This, along with Alan's narration, seemed to indicate Remedy's next game could be a follow up to Alan Wake.
